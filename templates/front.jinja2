    <p>How would you picture your poly relationship?  Now you can <a href="/create">build your own</a>.</p>

    <iframe src="/example" width="980" height="520" style="border:0;"></iframe>

    <p>With polycul.es, you can visualize your polyamorous relationship with a force directed graph.  The more strongly related two people are, the closer together they appear.  Each relationship can be annotated with text describing it.</p>

    <p>Relationships change.  When yours does, you can view your old visualization, then either click edit to edit the graph or inherit to create a new visualization based off the old one.</p>
